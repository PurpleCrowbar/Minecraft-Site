        <h2>The GamerLand</h2>
        <p>Since the dawn of time gamers have been oppressed. Either through bullying or taking the kids, normies have beaten us down. But now, we can come together as one, in the GamerLand, and break free of society's cruel grasp. We can be free. Only true gamers traverse these lands and only the very skilled survive. It is an open world where danger lurks around every corner; no where is safe. Being in GamerLand is like being in hell. Even God fears us, we are the most powerful miners out there. So will you join us? The choice is yours.</p><br>
